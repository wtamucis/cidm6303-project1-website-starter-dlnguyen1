    <h1>The Low-Down on the "Low-Rider": A Corgi Grooming & Health Guide</h1>
    <p><b>Pembroke Welsh Corgis</b> are a strong, athletic, and lively little herder who is affectionate and companionable without being needy, making them
        one of the most popular breeds in the United States.</p>
        <p>Owning a Corgi (whether a Pembroke or a Cardigan) is like living with a sentient loaf of bread that has a very loud opinion about everything. While they are undeniably cute, their unique physiology requires a specific maintenance routine to keep them happy and healthy.</p>

    <p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a cattle herding dog breed that originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales. The name Corgi is of Welsh origin, and is a compound of the words cor and ci, meaning "dwarf" and "dog", respectively. It is one of two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi, the other being the Cardigan Welsh Corgi</p>

        <li>Managing the <i>Corgi Glitter</i> (Shedding)
        <p>Corgis are double-coated dogs, meaning they have a soft undercoat for insulation and a coarse outer coat for weather protection.</p></li>
        <li>The <i>Feet Phenomenon</i>
            <p>Because Corgis are so low to the ground, their paws act like mops. They pick up mud, burrs, and allergens with ease.</p>
            <li>Protecting the Long Back
            <p>The most critical health aspect of a Corgi is their spine. Due to their long bodies and short legs, they are prone to <b>Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD)</b>.</p></li>
    <li>The Judgmental Loaf: Mental Health
        <p>Corgis are herding dogs, not lap dogs. A bored Corgi is a destructive Corgi.</p>
