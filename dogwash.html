    <h2>How to Wash a Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2>
    <p>Washing a Corgi is less of a chore and more of a tactical maneuver, primarily because you’re dealing with a double-coated "loaf" that seems to have a natural physical resistance to water.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Wash a Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Use a high-quality deshedding shampoo designed for double-coated dogs.</li>
            <li>Soak the dog thoroughly before applying shampoo to help penetrate the undercoat.</li>
            <li>Work the shampoo into the fur gently, focusing on areas where matting is common.</li>
            <li>Rinse thoroughly to avoid leaving any residue that could cause skin irritation.</li>
        </ol>

    <p><b>Note</b>: Once you manage to get them into the tub, the real challenge begins: penetrating that dense, weather-resistant undercoat requires a surprising amount of soaking and a high-quality deshedding shampoo. You’ll likely find yourself eye-level with their judgmental, "why have you betrayed me" expression, but stay firm—getting deep into those fur layers is the only way to tackle the inevitable "wet dog" smell. The real spectacle, however, occurs the moment you turn off the faucet. A Corgi’s full-body shake is a marvel of physics that can drench a bathroom (and its owner) in seconds. Between the heavy towel-drying and the lengthy blow-dry session needed to prevent damp skin, you'll definitely earn your workout for the day. By the time they’re fluffy, fragrant, and zooming around the house again, you’ll probably be the one needing a shower.</p>
